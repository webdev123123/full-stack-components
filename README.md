## Follow along

If you'd like to follow along, start by getting this running locally with the
following terminal commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/full-stack-components.git
cd ./full-stack-components
npm run setup
```

You'll be working within the app in `apps/01-before/`. Most of the work will be
in `apps/01-before/app/routes/resources/customers.tsx`, but you'll also need to
make a small change in `apps/01-before/app/routes/__app/sales/invoices/new.tsx`.

To run the dev server for the `01-before` app, run `node dev 1` in the root
directory of this repo.
